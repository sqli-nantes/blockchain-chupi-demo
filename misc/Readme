# NTP SERVER

In order to synchronize the bootnode computer and the Chupi Raspberry, an NTP server is set on the bootnode. 

## How to install it on the bootnode

* apt-get install ntp ntpdate
* nano /etc/ntp.conf
	* Replace #restrict 192.168.123.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust by restrict 0.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
	* Replace #broadcast 192.168.123.255 by broadcast <IP> where <IP> is the broadcast ip of the bootnode hotspot (Maybe 10.42.0.255)
	* Save it
* service ntp restart

## How to synchronize from Chupi

* apt-get install ntpdate
* ntpdate -dv <IP>
	where <IP> is the bootnode hotspot IP.
